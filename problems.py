Problem: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
Solution: If Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May, we need to calculate how many she sold in May and then add that to the number she sold in April to find the total.

Half of 48 is calculated as follows:
48 / 2 = 24

So, Natalia sold 24 clips in May.

Now, to find the total number of clips sold in April and May, we add the two amounts together:
48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72

Natalia sold a total of 72 clips in April and May combined.
Final Answer: The answer is $\\boxed{72}$."""

Solution: When $k=2$, the expression is equal to $2^3-2=6$. Next, note that $k^3-k=k(k-1)(k+1)$. This is divisible by 2, because one of $k$ and $k+1$ has to be divisible by $2$. This is also divisible by $3$ because one of $k-1, k, k+1$ is divisible by $3$. Therefore, it must be divisible by $6$.

Solution: We have that $10^{100} = 2^{100} \cdot 5^{100}$. If a divisor of $10^{100}$ is even, then it cannot have a units digit of $5$.

Therefore, all divisors with a units digit of $5$ must be of the form $5^{k}$, for $k=1, 2, \cdots, 100$. Therefore, thre are 100 divisors of $10^{100}$ with a units digit of $5$.

Solution: We have that $x^y = 4^{10} = 2^{20}$. Note that $x$ must be a power of $2$, because $2^{20}$ has no other prime factors. Therefore, we can have $x=2^a$, so that $x^y = 2^{ay} = 2^{20}$. 

Here, $a$ and $y$ can be anything, as long as $ay = 20$. Therefore, we just need to count the factors of $20$: $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$, so the answer is 6.

Solution: If something is divisible by $56$, then it must be divisible by $8$ and $7$. 

We know that for $n \ge 3$, the product will be divisible by $8$, because each integer is even.

Now, for the product to be divisible by $7$, one integer must be a multiple of $7$. Note that for any $7$ consecutive even integers, one must be divisible by $7$.

Therefore, when $n=7$, the statement is true. For $n=6$, observe that $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \cdot 10 \cdot 12$ is not divisible by $56$, because none of the integers is divisible by $7$.

Solution: Two of the angles must be equal. If the $30^{\circ}$ angle is one of them, then the angles must be $30^{\circ}, 30^{\circ}$, and $180^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 120^{\circ}$. If the $30^{\circ}$ angle is not one of them, then the other two angles must sum up to $180^{\circ} - 30^{\circ} = 150^{\circ}$, so each angle must be $75^{\circ}$. Therefore, the possibilities are $30^{\circ}, 120^{\circ}$, and $75^{\circ}$, so the answer is $30 + 120 + 75 = 225$.

Solution: The slope $m = \frac{2011 - 211}{b - 1} = \frac{1800}{b - 1}$ is an integer, so $(b - 1)$ divides $1800$. If $x$ is a positive factor of $1800$, then $1 + x$ and $1 - x$ are solutions for $b$, so each positive factor of $1800$ should be counted twice. Because $23 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2 = 1800$, we have $(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 3) = 36$ positive factors of $1800$, and therefore $2 \cdot 36 = 72$ possible values of $b$.

Solution: Let $x$ and $y$ be the side lengths of the rectangle. Then, the area is $xy$, the perimeter is $2x+2y=160$, and $x^2+y^2=d^2$ by the Pythagorean theorem. Since $2x+2y=160$, we have $x+y=80$. Note that $(x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = d^2 + 2xy$, so $xy = \frac{(x+y)^2 - d^2}{2} = \frac{80^2 - d^2}{2}$. Therefore, the area $xy$ is an integer if and only if $d$ is even. There are $\frac{70-60}{2} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$ even integers between $60$ and $70$, so the answer is $6$.

Solution: If we add the two equations, we get $x^2+y^2-2x+6y+10=0$. Completing the square, this can be rewritten as $(x-1)^2+(y+3)^2=0$, Since squares must be nonnegative, we must have $(x-1)^2=0$ and $(y+3)^2=0$, which means that $(x, y) = (1, -3)$ is the only solution.

Solution: Let's consider the prime factorization of $N$. First, notice that $N$ should only have powers of $2$ and $5$. Therefore, let $N = 2^x \cdot 5^y$. If $5N = 2^x \cdot 5^{y+1}$ is a perfect square, then $x$ and $y+1$ must be even. If $2N = 2^{x+1} \cdot 5^y$ is a perfect cube, then $x+1$ and $y$ must be multiples of $3$.
